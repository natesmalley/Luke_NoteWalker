# ðŸš€ Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Security Audit âœ…

### API Keys & Secrets
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Revoke any exposed API keys immediately
- [ ] Generate new API keys for production
- [ ] Store keys in secure environment variables or secret management service
- [ ] Verify `.env` file is NOT in version control
- [ ] Confirm `.env.template` contains only placeholders
- [ ] Test keychain integration for macOS deployment

### Code Security Review
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in any Python files
- [ ] No API keys in documentation or comments
- [ ] Input validation for all user-provided data
- [ ] AppleScript injection prevention verified
- [ ] Rate limiting configured for API calls
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information

### File Security
- [ ] `.gitignore` properly excludes all sensitive files
- [ ] No log files in repository
- [ ] No state files in repository
- [ ] No test data with real information
- [ ] Remove all development artifacts

## System Requirements âœ…

### Environment
- [ ] macOS 10.14+ verified
- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] Virtual environment configured
- [ ] All dependencies installed and version-locked
- [ ] AppleScript permissions configured

### Apple Notes Integration
- [ ] Notes.app automation permissions granted
- [ ] iCloud sync verified working
- [ ] Test with multiple note folders
- [ ] Verify Unicode and special character handling
- [ ] Test with large notes (>10KB)

## Performance & Reliability âœ…

### Resource Management
- [ ] Memory usage profiled under load
- [ ] API rate limits configured
- [ ] Concurrent request limits set
- [ ] Timeout values appropriate
- [ ] Cleanup handlers implemented

### Error Handling
- [ ] All API calls have retry logic
- [ ] Graceful degradation when providers fail
- [ ] State recovery after crashes tested
- [ ] Logging configured appropriately
- [ ] Error notifications setup (if needed)

## Testing Requirements âœ…

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Create new note â†’ triggers research
- [ ] Edit existing note â†’ detects changes
- [ ] Multiple note changes handled correctly
- [ ] Research confidence threshold working
- [ ] All research categories tested

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Claude API integration verified
- [ ] OpenAI API integration verified
- [ ] AppleScript execution stable
- [ ] iCloud sync functioning
- [ ] State persistence working

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty notes handled
- [ ] Very large notes processed
- [ ] Rapid note changes queued properly
- [ ] Network failures handled gracefully
- [ ] API quota exhaustion handled

## Monitoring & Logging âœ…

### Logging Setup
- [ ] Log rotation configured
- [ ] Log levels appropriate for production
- [ ] Sensitive data excluded from logs
- [ ] Log file permissions restricted
- [ ] Log storage location secured

### Metrics & Monitoring
- [ ] API usage tracking enabled
- [ ] Success/failure rates monitored
- [ ] Processing time metrics collected
- [ ] Resource usage monitored
- [ ] Alert thresholds configured

## Deployment Steps âœ…

### 1. Final Code Review
- [ ] Remove all debug code
- [ ] Remove all demo/test files
- [ ] Update version numbers
- [ ] Review all TODOs and FIXMEs
- [ ] Ensure code follows style guidelines

### 2. Configuration
- [ ] Production config values set
- [ ] Appropriate check intervals configured
- [ ] Confidence thresholds tuned
- [ ] Model selections optimized
- [ ] Token limits set appropriately

### 3. Documentation
- [ ] README.md accurate and complete
- [ ] API documentation current
- [ ] Configuration options documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide complete
- [ ] Support contact information updated

### 4. Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Backup strategy defined
- [ ] State recovery tested
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Data retention policy set
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan ready

## Post-Deployment Verification âœ…

### Immediate Checks (First Hour)
- [ ] Bot successfully starts
- [ ] Notes monitoring active
- [ ] First research operation successful
- [ ] Logs generating correctly
- [ ] No critical errors

### Short-term Monitoring (First Day)
- [ ] API usage within limits
- [ ] Memory usage stable
- [ ] Error rate acceptable
- [ ] Performance metrics normal
- [ ] User feedback positive

### Long-term Validation (First Week)
- [ ] System stability confirmed
- [ ] Cost projections accurate
- [ ] Scale testing if needed
- [ ] Performance optimization opportunities identified
- [ ] Feature requests collected

## Security Incident Response âœ…

### If API Keys Compromised
1. Immediately revoke compromised keys
2. Generate new keys
3. Update production configuration
4. Review logs for unauthorized usage
5. Report to API providers if abuse detected

### If System Compromised
1. Isolate affected system
2. Preserve logs for analysis
3. Review access patterns
4. Patch vulnerabilities
5. Redeploy from clean state
